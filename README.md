# Metal-cpp Headers

Collection of official and unofficial headers needed to work with Metal exclusively in C++.

The official metal-cpp resources force you to use some Obj-C in your project in order to make it work.
However, the C++ API for those uses exists, you just need the appropriate headers.

Apple itself published most of them in their [LearnMetalCpp resources](https://developer.apple.com/metal/LearnMetalCPP.zip).

They have some missing declarations, but can be easily added. This repo contains the ones needed for a simple "Hello Triangle" project using GLFW for the window management.
